Stock sim Discord bot.

## Installation

First, make sure to install Elixir: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

Fetch and install all dependencies
```shell
$ mix deps.get
```

Run the bot, locally (`start.sh` is not checked into the repo, so ask me for it directly)
```shell
$ ./start.sh
```

The bot will be automatically recompiled whenever you save a code change, but you should pay attention to the iex console (started by `./start.sh`) to find error messages.
