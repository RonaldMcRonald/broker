Stock sim Discord bot.

## Installation

First, make sure to install Elixir: https://elixir-lang.org/install.html

Fetch and install all dependencies
```shell
$ mix deps.get
```

Run the bot, locally (`start.sh` is not checked into the repo, so ask me for it directly)
```shell
$ ./start.sh
```

to restart the bot after making code changes, you can run this in the iex shell
```elixir
iex(1)> recompile
```
