TODO for Broker v1.0
- allow trades to be based on dollars or shares
- delay orders until market open
  - for "realism", delay orders until a few minutes after markets open
  - no leveraging, so we'll immediately take out the cash to cover the pending order
  - fulfill as much of dollar orders as possible
    - eg. $10 buys 3 x $3 and puts $1 back into cash
  - make sure to execute orders concurrently
    - with respect to a given trader's orders, but also with respect across all traders' orders
      - Task.async?, or is there some easy way to make these as fault-tolerant as possible?
    - confirm with each person
      - maybe as a single message report to prevent spamming channel?
  - !orders to show pending trades
    - also show in !me portfolio reports
- !price changes
  - new fields to add (with `diff` coloring)
    - regularmarketchange
    - regularmarketchangepercent
  - support comma separated list of tickers to do batch lookups
- portfolio reports at market close
  - something like:
    - traders |> Enum.map(!me) |> sort_by(net_worth) |> Enum.join("\n"))
- round against trader in all cases, to prevent abusing cheap stocks
- ! abbreviations
  - eg. !p = !price, !b = !buy, etc.
- !help to document the finalized API
- reset portfolios to end beta and launch 1.0
